### How to Enable Authentication:

2.  **Select Your Project**: Click on `pixel-universe-ub7uk`.
3.  **Navigate to Authentication**: In the left-hand menu, under the "Build" section, click on **Authentication**.
4.  **Get Started**: Click the **"Get started"** button.
5.  **Enable Sign-in Methods**:
    *   Go to the **"Sign-in method"** tab.
    *   Click on **"Email/Password"** from the list of providers.
    *   Enable the first toggle switch and click **"Save"**.
    *   (Optional) You can also enable other providers like Google, Facebook, etc., by following the same process.

**Without completing these steps, user registration and login will not work.**
