# **App Name**: Pixel Universe

## Core Features:

- Interactive Pixel Grid: Interactive pixel grid representing a map of Portugal sourced from a github repository, allowing users to zoom, pan, and reset the view. The grid should indicate regions and pixel density, and also provide coordinate and zoom information in real time. There will be an animated loading overlay.
- Minimap Navigation: Floating draggable panel for minimap interaction that enables navigation by coordinates, click region or location name.
- Dynamic Activity Feed: Dynamic activity feed for login, logout, purchase, pixel color, custom, recent view with user information. Includes quick filters and activity details.
- Statistics Panel: Display global platform metrics: purchases, pixel left and used.
- Action Menu: Intuitive touch-optimized floating quick action menu including pixel explorer, palette for custom colour, and statistic details
- AI Assisted Description Generation: If the user hovers their pointer or touches a pixel for 1 second, the application should provide the user the option of running a tool that leverages generative AI to automatically generate a description of the selected pixel, by analyzing the content on the surrounding area.
- Filters Navigation: Pixel filter include: all, bought, open, featured, recently update, to give flexibility the option the user need.
